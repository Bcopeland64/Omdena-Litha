And its probably premature, but we spent a whole lot of time with each other in the past week and a half and I was basically on cloud nine about the whole thing. And we were talking about going camping together which just sounded like a great idea. And he seemed to really be enjoying me and I was enjoying him and I was kind of wondering gee when is the honeymoon going to end. But... feeling like I was ready to enjoy it as long as it lasted And then he reported to me that he had talked to his mom and dad and they had inquired as to whether he had spent the night at my place or not and he told them that he had slept on the sofa which indeed he did. But then he was feeling like he couldn’t do that any more. And I felt hurt a little bit at that. And I’m not sure . .. I’m not sure, . .. I’m a little angry, where my anger is directed at. I’m a little confused . . as to whether it’s at his parents or at him. I think both. Um, probably the thing that that strikes me the most is that he would allow his parents to make decisions for him. I feel like... if he genuinely inside feels like its wrong to spend the night, if he feels like he doesn’t want to do that because he feels like it’s not right, then I can really accept that. I can accept and respect it either way, but that doesn’t get me angry. It makes me feel a little disappointed or, you know, \"shucks I want you to stay with me. I wish you didn’t feel that way.\" But I feel angrier with him I think because it seems to be the situation where he doesn’t deep down feel that way. It’s more like he feels like he has to do this for his parents. And I don’t know ... I guess um... I was involved in a two year relationship with a man who couldn’t make a commitment to me because he was married to his mother. And I’m cautious about getting involved in a situation that’s similar .... I see, there’s ... a difference ... if he ... if he really um ... I think some people can really feel that they want do something for their parents because their parents request it and on the other hand, \"Gee I got to that because its my parents wishes.\" See, I don’t operate like that.
